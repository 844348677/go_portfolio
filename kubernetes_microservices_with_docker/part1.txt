installing kubernetes using docker

Kubernetes is software for managing a cluster of Docker containers.

A Pod is a collection of one or more Docker containers with single interface features such as providing networking and filesystem at the Pod level rather than at the container level.

installing kubernetes
kubernetes is an open source container cluster manager. the main components of kubernetes are the following
1 etcd
2 kubernetes master
3 service proxy
4 kubelet

etcd is a simple, secure, fast and reliable distributed key-value store
kubernetes master exposes the kubernetes API using which containers are run on nodes to handle tasks
kubelet ia an agent that runs on each node to monitor the containers running on the node, restarting them if required to keep the replication level
A service proxy runs to each node to provide the kubernetes service interface for clients. a service is an abstraction fro the logical set of pods represented by the service, and a service selector is used to select the pods represented by the service. the service proxy routes the client traffice to a matching pod. labels are used to match a service with a pod

optionally create a directory (/kubernetes) to install kubernetes and permissions to global(777)

sudo mkdir /kubernetes
sudo chmod -R 777 /kubernetes

change directory to the /kubernetes directory and start the Docker engine

cd kubernetes/
pwd
/home/liuh/docker/kubernetes
sudo service docker start

set some Linux kernel parameter

cd /boot
ls -l
uname -r
sudo vi config-4.4.0-130-generic

CONFIG_RESOURCE_COUNTERS=y
CONFIG_MEMCG=y
CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP=y
CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP_ENABLED=y
CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM=y

Most of the configs listed earlier are already turned on . The CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP_ENABLED config is not set
Set CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP_ENABLED=y and save the kernel configuration file 

Next, we need to add support fro memory and swap accounting to the kernel. the command-line parameters provided to the kernel may be listed with the following command

cat /proc/cmdline

Grub2 is the default boot loader for Ubuntu. to turn on memeory and swap accounting, open the /etc/default/grub file in the editor. The GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX is set to an empty string 

set the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX as follow, which enables memory and swap accounting in the kernel at boot

CRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX  = "cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1"

Update the grub.cfg file with the following command

sudo update-grub

Reboot the system

sudo reboot

Return the command to list the command-line kernel parameters

cat /proc/cmdline

Having set the prerequisite kernel parameter, next we shall start the Kubernetes componets etcd, master, and service proxy
