installing kubernetes
kubernetes is an open source container cluster manager. the main components of kubernetes are the following
1 etcd
2 kubernetes master
3 service proxy
4 kubelet

etcd is a simple, secure, fast and reliable distributed key-value store
kubernetes master exposes the kubernetes API using which containers are run on nodes to handle tasks
kubelet ia an agent that runs on each node to monitor the containers running on the node, restarting them if required to keep the replication level
A service proxy runs to each node to provide the kubernetes service interface for clients. a service is an abstraction fro the logical set of pods represented by the service, and a service selector is used to select the pods represented by the service. the service proxy routes the client traffice to a matching pod. labels are used to match a service with a pod

optionally create a directory (/kubernetes) to install kubernetes and permissions to global(777)
