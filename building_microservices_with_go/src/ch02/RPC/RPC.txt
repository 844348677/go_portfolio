RPC APIs

RPC stands for remote procedure call
it is a method of exucuting a function or method on a remote machine
interface defination
SOAP , Thrift Protocal Buffers
make it easier to generate client and server stubs fro different technology stacks
using a DSL (domain specific language)
create application clients and serverrs
REST need to use HTTP as a transport layer
RPC is not bound by this constraint

JMI was tightly bound
quickly generate a client for your users

RPC API design
a good RESTful API
one of the main different : you may not be using HTTP as your transport
the benefits
using binary serialization is incredibly efficient on the network and
no longer have the tight coupling that RMI and CORBA enforced

RPC message frameworks

Gob

Thrift

Protocal Buffers
providing a DSL
generator (written in C) reads can can generate client and server stubs for over ten languages
pluggable architecture
not just RPC
they are coupled to the gRPC framework
gRPC uses protocal buffers as the method for serializing and de-serializing structured data
Protocal buffer service defination
service User{
    rpc CreateUser(User) return (Error){}
}
message User{
    required string name = 1;
    required int32 id = 2;
    optional string email = 3;
}
message Error{
    optional code int32 = 1
    optional detail string =2
}

JSON-RPC
a standard way of representing objects for RPC using JSON
removes the need to decode any proprietary binary protocal at the expense of transfer speed

Filtering

Versioning APIs
when you should version
Breaking changes include
Removing or renaming APIs or API parameters
Changing the type of an API parameter, for example , from integer to string
Changing to response code,error codes, or fault contracts
Changes to the behavior of an existing API

Things that do not involve a breaking change include
Adding parameter to a returned entity
Adding additional endpoints or functionality
Bug fixes or other  maintenance that does not include items in the breaking changes list
