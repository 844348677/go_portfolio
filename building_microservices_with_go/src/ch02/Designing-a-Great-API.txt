Writing an API contract feel part art , part science and ,
two most popular options
RESTful and RPC

RESTful APIs

"REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions generality of interfaces ,
independent deployment of components,
andintermediary components to reduce interaction latency,
enforce security and encapsulate legacy systems"

URIs
One of the main components in the HTTP protocol is a URI
URI Uniform Resource Identifiers
URL Uniform Resource Locator
URI 和 URL 讨论了一整页，哈哈哈，最后决定使用URI,URL是非正式的概念
a URL is a type of URI that identifies a resource via its network location

URI format

URI path design for REST services

Collections
GET/cats -> All cats in the collection
GET/cats/1 -> Single document for a cat 1

Documents
GET/cats/1  -> Single document for cat 1
GET/cats/1/kittents -> All kittens  belonging to cat 1
GET/cats/1/kittens/1    -> kitten 1 for cat 1

Controller
POST/cats/1/feed  -> Feed cat 1
POST/cats/1/feed?food=fish  -> Feed cat 1 a fish

Store
PUT/cats/2
this would add a new cat to the store with an ID of 2

CRUD function names
when designing great REST URIs we never use a CURD function name as part of the URI,
instead we use a HTTP verb
DELETE/cats/1234
antipattern:
GET/deleteCat/1234
DELETE/deleteCat/1234
POST/cats/1234/delete

HTTP verbs
