Metrics :
these are things such as time series data (for example, transaction or individual component timings)
Text-based logs :
Text-based records are your real old-fashioned logs which are spat out by things such as Nginx or a text log from your application software
Exceptions :
exceptions potentially could fall into the two previous categories ; however , I like to break these out into a separate category since exception should be , well , exceptional
