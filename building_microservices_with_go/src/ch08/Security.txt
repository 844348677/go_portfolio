Security

Encryption and signing

Symmetric-key encryption
secret-key or conventional cryptography : one key is used for both the encryption and decryption of the data
for a remote end to be able to decryt this information , it must first have the key ,
and this key must be securely held as a single compromise of on server will lead to the compromise of all servers who share this key

Public-key cryptography
to get around the need for both sides requiring to know the secret
public-key cryptography uses a pair of keys of encryption
asymmetric encryption
The public key is used for encrypting information while the private can only be used fro decrypting

Digital signatures
A digital signature works by encrypting a message with a private key and then transferring the signed message
if the message can be decrypted with public key , then the message must have originated from the holder of a private key
create oneway hash of the message and then use the private key to encrypt this .
the recipient will decrypt the hash  with the public key and generate the same hash from the message; then , the message can be deemed to be from a trustworthy source

X.509 digital certificates

TLS/SSL

External security

Layer 2 or 3 firewalls
Layer is more commonly used for routing as it deals purely with MAC addresses and not IP addresses whereas layer 3 is IP address aware
Heartbleed

Web application firewall

API Gateway

DDos protection
