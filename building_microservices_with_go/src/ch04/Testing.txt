Testing

"The art of a good nigth's sleep is knowing you will not get woken by a support call and
piece of mind from being able to confidently change your software in a always moving market"

the principle fo releasing little and often provides significent business benefits;
the downside(or the benefit, depending on your viewpoint) to releasing little and often is that
you can no longer spend three months running through a regresiion test suite before you release to market

one of the biggest problem with change is the concern that
the change you are making may have an undesirable effect on another part of the system
this effect applies to microservices as well as large monolithic systems

The testing pyramid
Succeeding with Agile

Cucumber, BDD
1 focus on one scenario
2 write failing step defination

Unit test
3 wirte a failing test
4 get test to pass
5 Refactor

6 When step passes
7 Refactor

Gherkin

Unit tests

let's just remind ourselves awesome Uncle Bob Marin in his book Clean Code
First law:
You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test
Second law:
You my not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing
Third law:
You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test

Dependency injection and mocking
we will pass our dependencies into our handler rather creating them internally

Code coverage

go test -cover ./...

Behavioral Driven Development
BDD
is a technique often executed by an application framework called Cucumber

Testing with Docker Compose
More often than not you are going to be using a functioniong database
spin up a real database and to do that we can use Docker-Compose as it is a fantastic way of starting our denpendies

version: '2'
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo
    ports:
        - 27017:27017

run docker-compose up command
download the image of MongoDB and start an instance exposing there ports on our local host

We now need to creat a new struct in our project which is going to implement the store interface
