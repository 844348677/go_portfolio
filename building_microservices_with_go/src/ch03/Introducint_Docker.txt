Introducint Docker

Introducing Containers with Docker
the desire to simplify the process of building,shipping ,and running application

A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it:
code, runtime, system tools, system libraries , setting
Containers isolate software from its surroundings, for example, differences between development and staging
environments and help reduce conflicts between teams running different software on the same infrastructure

Containers have become the primary choice fro package microservices
Containers work by isolating processes and filesystems from each other

Installing Docker

Running our first container

think of it like types and instances ,
 a type defines fields and methods making up behavior
 an instance is a living instantiation of this type

 docker run --rm hello-world

 when you execute a docker run the first thing the engine does is check to see if you have the image isntalled locally
 if it doesn't then it connects to the default registry, to retrieve it

 the --rm flag tells the Docker engine to remove the container and delete any resources such as volumes it was using on exit
